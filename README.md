# raytracer
Experimenting with creating a CPU raytracer. Main resource is [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)


Currently renders only spheres. Has three material types: diffuse, metallic, dielectric.

*Showcase of the current version of the renderer, implements all of "Raytracing in one weekend"'s core functions + multi-threading*
